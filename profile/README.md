## André Flitsch (@pixelperfectat)

Senior software engineer & e-commerce integration specialist based in Austria.

I design and maintain **robust backend systems**, with a strong focus on **Magento 2 / Adobe Commerce**, data pipelines, and long-lived codebases that need to evolve safely.

---

### What I work on

- **Magento 2 extensions** (production-grade, maintainable, PHPStan-clean)
- **System integrations** (ERP ↔ PIM ↔ Shop ↔ CRM)
- **Data transformation pipelines** (imports, exports, normalization)
- **Refactoring legacy PHP** into modern, testable architectures
- **Automation & CI/CD** for real-world commerce platforms

I care about correctness, backward compatibility, and code that survives multiple major version upgrades.

---

### Open-source focus

Most of my repositories are:
- Solving **real merchant problems**
- Designed for **extension, not hacks**
- Opinionated where Magento is vague
- Tested against real production constraints

You’ll find:
- Magento 2 modules (discounts, checkout, Hyvä, integrations)
- Tooling & helper libraries
- Infrastructure and automation experiments

If a repo looks small, it’s usually because it does **one thing well**.

### Tech stack (daily use)

- **PHP 8.x**, Symfony components
- **Magento 2 / Adobe Commerce**
- **Akeneo PIM**
- Docker, CI pipelines, automated QA
- MySQL, Elasticsearch / OpenSearch

---

### Philosophy

- Prefer boring, explicit code over clever abstractions
- Refactor in safe, reviewable steps
- Tests are contracts, not decorations
- If it can’t be upgraded, it’s technical debt
